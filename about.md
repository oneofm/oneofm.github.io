<p class="message">
 Hey there! I am Cong Wang, a software engineer. My friends also call me Kurt. While loving my motherland China deeply, I dream about working for the leading technology companies in US. I am currently continuing my graduate study at Rutgers University, New Jersey. Of all the areas of Computer Science, Machine Learning fascinates me most. Aside from that, I like sports and cooking.
